    The <b>'Draft'</b> page of this web-application provides tables for each of the draftable positions for fantasy hockey: "Left Wing, Center, Right Wing, Defense, Goalie". Using ranking information, it organizes each of the players within a certain position, such that you can view the best available options at any given point in time. Clicking on a player in a table will remove them (i.e., they've been drafted), and they will join the pool of players who have been drafted in the 'drafted' table. 
  </p>
  <p align="left">
    The <b>'Your Team'</b> page is incomplete, but will allow you to see your team as you are drafting, and will supply charts showing you what positions you have filled and what positions you should focus on.
